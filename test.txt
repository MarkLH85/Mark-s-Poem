This is a Test - This is my first poem! 

This is only a test
not an actual poem. 
I don't know what to write,
so I'll just write anything.
I am a visionary and a student.
I want to be a master and an artist.
I want to be a helper and a fighter.
I am not selfish, I just want to help.
I have a knack for wanting to learn.
See what this baby can do. 
If you like this, then maybe I'll keep doing this.
If you don't then I'll keep trying.
Practice makes perfect.
Innovation, that is the key.
I am the master.
I am who I am.
I am the creator of these works.
I am my own programmer.
 
You thought I was done. Well you're wrong. Now I'm done.
Kidding I'm back.
Now I'm done.
